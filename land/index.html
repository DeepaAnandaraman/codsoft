            <div class="dish" data-name="Signature Dish 5 : Italian Wedding Soup" data-price="$98" data-description="This hearty soup combines tender meatballs, veggies, and pasta in a rich and flavorful broth. The name “wedding soup” comes from the Italian phrase minestra maritata, which means “married soup,” signifying the harmonious blend of flavors. Traditionally, it’s made from a long-cooked homemade chicken stock, but you can achieve a similar rich flavor by using a combination of high-quality store-bought broths fortified with wine and lots of veggies. The meatballs are a key component, and rolling them can be a bit tedious (the recipe makes 50!), but it’s well worth it. Serve Italian Wedding Soup with warm bread, like focaccia, and a Caesar salad for a complete meal! ">
